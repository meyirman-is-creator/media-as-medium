                <div class="article__text">How long are you awake in the morning before you go online? Perhaps it’s
                    while you’re still lying in bed, using a news feed or social media as the needed stimulant to push
                    you out from under the covers. Or maybe you wait to open your device until after a warm shower and
                    cup of coffee. If you use sleep tracking apps, you might say you never signed off in the first
                    place.
                    <br><br>And, like millions of others during the pandemic, the internet is probably what enabled you
                    to stay in touch with family, or complete entire years of work and/or school remotely. If this
                    sounds familiar, then you live in a part of the world where an internet connection now counts as an
                    essential utility — one that’s as easy to take for granted as the natural gas heating your shower
                    water or the electricity powering your coffee maker.
                    <br><br>But if you think we’re hyperconnected today, just wait. Globally, just over 55% of today’s
                    households have an internet connection. This gap between the internet haves and have-nots is
                    referred to as the digital divide, and access is skewed toward richer nations. The gap is projected
                    to close in the next decade as billions of homes connect to the internet for the first time and by
                    2030 it’s estimated that the technology industry could account for 20% of the global electricity
                    demand. This presents a troublesome dichotomy. On one hand, it supports livelihoods, educations, and
                    bolsters the global economy; on the other hand, the increased usage of the apps, websites, and
                    services that we build will place an even greater strain on our already-overloaded power grids.
